# inventory-system
An inventory and sales tracking system records products, tracks stock levels, logs sales and purchases, and produces reports. It prevents stockouts. It shows revenue and cost. It enforces simple business rules (stock decrement on sale).

This project is a full-stack fabric store management system designed to help store owners manage inventory, customers, orders, and sales operations digitally. The system uses React for the frontend, Django REST Framework for the backend API, and MySQL as the primary database. 

Users can browse available fabrics, check prices, view product details, and place orders through a clean and responsive interface.Store admins can log in to manage the entire inventory by adding new fabrics, updating quantities, setting prices, and monitoring real-time stock status. The project also includes features such as user authentication, order tracking, secure payment integration, search and filtering, and basic analytics for monthly sales performance. 

The API is built to be scalable and can support mobile apps or future third-party integrations. MySQL ensures reliable data storage and fast queries even at larger data sizes. Ultimately, the system provides a modern digital solution that replaces manual record-keeping with a structured, automated workflow that improves efficiency, saves time, and enhances customer experience.
